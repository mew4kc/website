      <description>Title: The Consistency of Voting Habits among College Students 
Date: 4-1-2020 
Abstract: For generations, it was suggested that college students do not vote, despite research suggesting that voting is habit forming and youth voting can determine the trend for future civic engagement. The purpose of this project is to determine if voter disenfranchisement is the cause of such a lack of civil engagement among college students.</description>
